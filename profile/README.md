# Welcome to the official ilo sama RAIL GitHub page!
> We're the ilo sama RAIL (iR) team, a collective of (currently) three TSW modders making various stuff in and around TSW, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, but always to the best of our abilities! :3

## Hiya!
As the short introduction above suggests, we're the ilo sama RAIL team, and the three of us work on many different types of mods for TSW, be it enhancement packs, repaints, sound mods, routes, locos, or any other things. As we're a rather small team with lives outside of TSW, be it in university or college, we might not always be able to invest our time into our railway-related projects, but we will always try our best to create the most accurate experiences with our mods.

## The Name
During the very early days of this group, back when we used to work on a Roblox train simulator, the founders called their then new group "interRail", short "iR". Well, if you've been in the european railway sphere for a bit, you might notice a certain name conflict there. Yeah, the silly people who founded the group didn't check whether the name was already in use and only found out months later, when everything they had worked on already included said name. Very silly.
In early 2024, it was finally decided to rename this group. Though, what would the new name be? We wanted to keep the "iR" abbreviation, so we already had some tight requirements. Months earlier, Nagi had picked up the conlang Toki Pona, which led her to decide that the name would be in that language. Fast forward a few weeks, and we landed on our current name. "ilo sama" can be interpreted as something along the lines of "look-alike machines" (properly translating it is quite difficult), and that's basically what we're trying to achive - look-alike and feel-alike, or realistic implementations of machines, trains, and everything around that. Now, we had to refer to the railway for this gig, so we just slapped a "RAIL" onto it, to conserve the "R" in the "iR" abbreviation.

## FAQ
### Are you supposed to scream the "RAIL" part of the name?
Unless you don't want to wake up anyone, sure, why not.

## Contact
Did you find an issue, saw some room for improvement or want to reach out to us for other reasons? You can do so by pinging one of our team on the TSC Discord, by leaving a comment on the respective mod page, by creating an issue on the respective GitHub repositiry (if available), or reaching out via the email on our profile. We tend be quicker on Discord, so we would prefer you to reach out via that. :)
